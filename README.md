# Link_Checker
Empowered by VirusTotal
The script imports the requests library to make HTTP requests to the VirusTotal API. It takes a URL as input. Sends a GET request to the VirusTotal. Parses the JSON response and checks if the URL is in the VirusTotal database and reports the scan results.
This script provides a basic example. It can be further expanded by adding more error handling, logging, or integrating with other threat intelligence APIs for a more comprehensive tool.
